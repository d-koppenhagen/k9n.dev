# ngx-semantic-version

My project **ngx-semantic-version** is an Angular Schematic that will add and configure [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org), [commitizen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commitizen), [husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky) and [standard-version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/standard-version) to enforce commit messages in the _conventional commit_ format and to automate your release and Changelog generation by respecting _semver_.
All you have to do for the setup is to execute this command in your Angular CLI project:

```bash
ng add ngx-semantic-version
```

Check out my article [_ngx-semantic-version: enhance your git and release workflow_](/blog/2019-11-ngx-semantic-version) to learn more about it.

The official documentation for _ngx-semantic-version_ can be found on [Github](https://github.com/d-koppenhagen/ngx-semantic-version) or [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-semantic-version).
