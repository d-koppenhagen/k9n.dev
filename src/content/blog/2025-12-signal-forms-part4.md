title: "Angular Signal Forms Part 4: Metadata and Accessibility Handling"
description: "In the previous parts of this series, we've covered the fundamentals of Signal Forms, advanced validation patterns, and modular form architecture. In this final part, we'll explore the power of assigning field metadata. We'll also have a look at how we can automatically add helpful ARIA attributes based on a field state to make our forms even more inclusive and accessible."
