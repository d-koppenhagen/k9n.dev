Since April 2023, I am actively maintaining and evolving the [vue3-openlayers library](https://vue3openlayers.netlify.app/) — An OpenLayers Wrapper for Vue3.
My original intention was just to fix some bugs and add some features I needed this time in my current project.
But after a while using this project I really loved it and was motivated enough to get more involved into the project.
I contributed actively and got in touch with Melih Altıntaş, the creator of this library.
He was really supportive and made me an official Maintainer of the project.
Since then I shifted the whole project to be based on TypeScript, streamlined the APIs and added several new features and bug fixes.
